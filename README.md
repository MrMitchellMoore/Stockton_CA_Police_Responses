## Data Sourcing and Collection
### I went on stockton, ca website to get the dataset. The dataset comprised of multiple csv files from years 2021-2023.

## ETL Process
### The csv files were massive so i have to import them into SQL. Perform data cleaning and formatting on each file. I joined files together to make one table. I then exported it and used Python for filtering and aggregation. This was a chance to sharpen my skills with Python and see how my work flow could benefit. I then used numpy and pandas for filtering and aggregation. Creating categories on the different policies responses to further organize how I was going to visualize the data. Then exported it into Tableau.

## Visualizations
### In Tableau I made multiple dashboards to represent the different police responses in the different districts and zipcodes.
